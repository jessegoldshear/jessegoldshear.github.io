I am a rising 5th year doctoral student and NIH F31 fellow in Health Behavior Research at USC Keck in the department of Population and Public Health Sciences. My research utilizes community-engaged methods to better understand the health impact of structural disadvantages on unhoused people who use drugs. In practice, this involves combining my love of mutual aid and harm reduction service provision with participant observation and other qualitative data collection methods. Both this and my skills in quantitative methods are being used in the conduct of my dissertation. Working in and with the harm reduction community is at the core of my research ethos and I would be nowhere without my community partners, friends, and participants. At USC, I've been mentored by [Dr. Ricky Bluthenthal](https://profiles.sc-ctsi.org/ricky.bluthenthal), while at Drexel University I was mentored by [Dr. Alexis Roth](https://drexel.edu/dornsife/academics/faculty/Alexis%20Roth/). 

Outside of academics I enjoy spending time with my wife and family, hiking, rock climbing and bouldering, coffee, and playing Dungeons & Dragons.
